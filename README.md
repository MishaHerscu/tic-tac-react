# Tic Tac React

[Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1m7IxyBZjDyF-6dVA0019E3tZlZdCfpmfqsE_4kNlgIM/edit?usp=sharing)

* This is a simple app that demonstrates basic React functionality.
* It is a browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that does not persist user data.
* There is no API right now.
* Potential extension: using the Game-Project API to store user sessions and account data
* Potential extension: using the JS-Template to get a good Grunt file so that there will be a build for gh-pages and linting.
* Potential extension: I used just the 1-basic-react repo linked below as starter code, I could try to use more advanced React e.g. Redux

# Tic Tac React

## Presentation
[Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1m7IxyBZjDyF-6dVA0019E3tZlZdCfpmfqsE_4kNlgIM/edit?usp=sharing)

## Summary
* This is a simple app that demonstrates basic React functionality.
* It is a browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that does not persist user data.
* There is no API right now.
* Potential extension: using the Game-Project API to store user sessions and account data
* Potential extension: using the JS-Template to get a good Grunt file so that there will be a build for gh-pages and linting.
* Potential extension: I used just the 1-basic-react repo linked below as starter code, I could try to use more advanced React e.g. Redux

## Installation steps required (from video):

1. Fork starter code repo
2. Clone
3. Run "npm install" in any repo you are going to develop
4. Run "webpack"
5. Run "webpack --watch" (to see changes)
6. Run "npm run dev" - this should launch on localhost:8080
7. If this doesn't work, watch the video and follow the additional instructions


## Live website

The site is more fully styled and functional run locally because the build is missing.

That said, you can see the site live [here](https://mishaherscu.github.io/tic-tac-react/src/)
